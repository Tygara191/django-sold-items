## About

This is a Django app that administrates the items in an online store. I originally wrote this app in the context of an AC store, which is the reason that the words "klimatik, klimatici" are found widely throughout the app. This repo is the result of me extracting the app from its original context, touching it up to work standalone and making a repo out of it.

The code comes as-is. If you like some part of it, feel free to use whatever you like with absolutely no warrenty of any nature from me.

My main motive to upload the app to github is to have it serve as a demonstration of my Django skills for potential employers to look at.

The app supports the following features:

1. AC categories
2. AC attributes, including energy classes, manufacturers, room sizes etc.
3. Listing, searching and sorting through all the mentioned attributes.
4. Temporary discounts with auto percentage calculation etc
5. Customer feedback for every AC
6. Auto image watermarking
7. Full Django admin support

Can and probably should be refactored for selling different items with their unique attributes.
